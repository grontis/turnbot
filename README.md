# Turnbot
A discord bot for running a text channel turn based RPG. 

Ever been frustrated and disappointed with the challenge of trying to get a handful of adults with conflicting schedules together on one night a week on a regular basis to play a TTRPG? I have. That's what inspired me to try and create a bot like this one.

The goal of this project is to provide a simple and asynchronous way to play together with some friends.
